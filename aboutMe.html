            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm a passionate DJ and music producer with a love for high-energy beats and unforgettable nights. From underground techno to house and experimental sets, I aim to create a unique atmosphere at every event. Over the years, I've played in clubs, private events, and music festivals across Europe, always blending sounds that get people moving. Music is more than a jobâ€”it's my way of connecting with people and creating lasting memories on the dancefloor.</p>
